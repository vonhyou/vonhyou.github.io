[{"content":"On the first day of 2021, I had the intention of writing an article of a summary nature, unsuccessfully.\nThere are many reasons for this, the main one being that the past four months have been so unsuccessful that rushing around can only produce words that are heavily emotional. So choose to do a summary (and of course \u0026ldquo;outlook\u0026rdquo;) today after almost three months is the most appropriate.\nAt the beginning of the idea, I tried to sort out the time in my head, but I gave up before I was halfway through. As Alex Chiof SJTU of self-deprecatingly put it: \u0026ldquo;My failure was mediocre \u0026ldquo;. But the difference is that my failure is also monotonous in the eyes of mediocre people. So the final decision is to write wherever I can think of.\nMemoirs (Confessions) Anything that happens can always be traced back (a long time) to a series of decisions, and the subjects who make decisions are non-independent individuals shaped by a series of experiences, so the real sense of \u0026ldquo;traceability\u0026rdquo; should at least be the birth of the studied individuals. This is obviously a pipe dream, and I do not have the idea or capital to write an autobiography. Common sense dictates that the most appropriate anchor point would be one morning in mid-August \u0026ndash; the day I awoke from a dream at 10:30 a.m. and automatically gave up the opportunity to study at a university in Macau on time. Then sleepy-eyed I opened zhihu casual browsing, inadvertently found the truth taht Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications' software engineering program in Chongqing and some areas is the second batch of admission.\nA self-directed nightmare began sparingly.\nBeginning of the semester (Start) The flight from Jinan to Chongqing took about two and half an hours. the dark, hazy cabin and continuous noise kept pulling me back to reality, urging me to think and plan about my future life. Having unanimously passed on the U.S.-based transfer program just before boarding, the man who in the \u0026ldquo;escape plan vacuum\u0026rdquo; decided to wait and see for a while and make a self-help self-congratulation \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;After all, students in Shandong don\u0026rsquo;t have restrictions on changing their major\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Even if I can\u0026rsquo;t change my major, my efforts for four years won\u0026rsquo;t be that bad\u0026rdquo;. The family had a lot of fun in the following days, at least not since the second grade.\nThen we moved into the dormitory, class meetings, received textbooks, classes, and group building. The English class was very relaxed, except for the group communication, which was a lot of work; I won\u0026rsquo;t comment on the rest of the class. It was not until some computer practice class started, and then programming fundamentals were on the schedule, that everything changed.\nMid-semester (Development) No one wants to read too many complaints, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to write them, and in case any of the words poke the \u0026ldquo;soft spot\u0026rdquo; of people who have an impact on my future plans, it\u0026rsquo;s not good. The general situation is that everything is not as simple as it seems, and the problem is not something that can be solved simply by effort, not to mention that I am not the kind of person with high enough execution. When the subjective individual character flaws and objective conditions of the dirty place fit perfectly, the poor guy is like a giant beast caught in a tar pit, pretending to struggle to find the deeper you fall, simply listen to God and enjoy the fall.\nIt still seems like an exaggeration to say that.\nFortunately, I have found a good way to escape \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;Datsu-A Ron\u0026rdquo;.\nThe cause was pretty tame, probably from some OIer in a similar situation who heard that it was possible to apply to a German university using \u0026ldquo;Gaokao\u0026rdquo; results. I looked at it and felt it was good, and the parents looked at it and felt it was feasible. Anyway, the matter was on the agenda.\nAfter that, I was surprised to find that college life was so easy. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to \u0026ldquo;Baoyan\u0026rdquo;, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to participate in all kinds of strange competitions (such as the Mathematical Model and Blue Bridge Cup, especially the latter is amazingly low); if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to \u0026ldquo;Kaoyan\u0026rdquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary for you to spend too much time on politics; if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to get a scholarship, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to participate in all kinds of volunteer activities to get the HOURS. All unnecessary activities can be put off as soon as possible. Not active? Yes! I\u0026rsquo;m not active! (proud face)\nIn short, everything is on the right track by mistake. Whether this is the right path or not, but I believe that in this university now this professional rules four years out is certainly not to achieve the goal. After three years of junior high school and three years of high school, I really do not want to experience this self-imposed exile, and I do not want to use \u0026ldquo;see reality\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;gradually mature\u0026rdquo; arguments to beautify my own degradation.\nI got my first APS after midterms, and had to wait a long time for the remaining nine due to the epidemic (I got them at home in February \u0026lsquo;21). All in all everything was moving along smoothly and I experienced a sense of security that I had lacked for a long time.\nEnd of semester (milestone) Content omitted.\nEnding Words Content omitted.\nPlans during undergraduate（Bechelor）period Content invisible.\n","permalink":"https://blog.lenva.tech/posts/summary-and-planning-01/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn the first day of 2021, I had the intention of writing an article of a summary nature, unsuccessfully.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Summary and Planning 01"},{"content":"   friend site     Sakurai Kaede\u0026rsquo;s Blog sakurai.in   某岛 shuizilong.com   moi的一般通过小站 rain.moimo.me   CANARYPWN\u0026rsquo;S NATïVE BLOG aaaab3n.moe   Labelray\u0026rsquo;s Blog blog.labelray.top   Kevin\u0026rsquo;s Blog blog.kevinfly.com   Raptazure raptazure.github.io   银河美术馆 beautyyu.one   红茶馆 onlyblacktea.cn   RAY ELDATH han.ninja   Lovely\u0026rsquo;s Blog blog.dmcmi.top   明心 subrige.xyz   VOY青年之声 gmdlvoy.blogspot.com   ムえ blog.murez.site   Oliver\u0026rsquo;s Blog manito.fun   辇道增七的小站 wuhaoda.life   Broca的个人博客 phenol-phthalein.info   ZHANGWP\u0026rsquo;s Blog www.zhangwp.com   巽星莊 shviolet.tk    ","permalink":"https://blog.lenva.tech/links/","summary":"friend site     Sakurai Kaede\u0026rsquo;s Blog sakurai.in   某岛 shuizilong.com   moi的一般通过小站 rain.moimo.me   CANARYPWN\u0026rsquo;S NATïVE BLOG aaaab3n.moe   Labelray\u0026rsquo;s Blog blog.labelray.top   Kevin\u0026rsquo;s Blog blog.kevinfly.com   Raptazure raptazure.github.io   银河美术馆 beautyyu.one   红茶馆 onlyblacktea.cn   RAY ELDATH han.ninja   Lovely\u0026rsquo;s Blog blog.dmcmi.top   明心 subrige.xyz   VOY青年之声 gmdlvoy.blogspot.com   ムえ blog.","title":"Links"},{"content":"In order to simplify the whole site and improve reading experience on mobile devices, I shifted to Hugo, themed PaperMod.\nintroduction Every time I want to make a change, I always go for something new first —— register a domain name, write a TODOlist, and rebuild the blog with a different technology stack than before.

But after typing and runing, I was totally shocked —— It\u0026rsquo;s output is \u0026quot;hello, world\u0026quot; and 2!\nWhat actually gets printed as a two, because that i +1 is evaluated right there when the first statement, when it hits the differed statement, the i +1 is evaluated and at that time, i is a one, so i +1 is a two. So, later when the differed statement actually gets executed it\u0026rsquo;s still prints a two.\n","permalink":"https://blog.lenva.tech/posts/defer-in-go/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe defer keyword is found in many modern programming languages, and Go\u0026rsquo;s defer executes the passed-in function before the current function or method returns.

I cannot find a better algorithm to work as well as this (in C++).\nThe \u0026ldquo;Better\u0026rdquo; Way in Golang At the beginning, I wrote a same function as usual in Go like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  func getMax(arr []int, n int) int { var flag int = arr[0] for i := 1; i \u0026lt; n; i++ { if arr[i] \u0026gt; flag { flag = arr[i] } } return flag }   Ok, I had completed the task perfectly. But I learned a new way to do the same thing elegantly. Furthermore, it uses some excellent features like ruby. Now let me show you the code.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  func getMax(vals ...int) int { flag := MINN for _, v range vals { if v \u0026gt; flag { flag = v } } return flag }   ... is a powerful sign and widely used in Go(and very very misleading). It can unfold slices and arrays.\nAfter writing this post, I suddenly felt it was nothing. I can write this function more beautiful by using another languages.\nStarting with C++ does really restrict my mind.Every time I use languages such as ruby, I felt like dancing with tight feet. It\u0026rsquo;s bad.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all, thank you.
